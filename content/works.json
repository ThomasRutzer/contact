    "description": "art+com led the exhibition design of the futurium, a brand new museum in Berlin.\n I was part of the team which has been responsible for a solid infrastructure as well as for multiple exhibits itself. The infrastructure includes automated deployment via ansible and a backend with multiple services around a mqtt-broker, which guarantees realtime communication across all the exhibits. Various sensors enhance the user interaction and are also connected to exhibits by mqtt.",

    "description": "In context of qurator reasearch collaboration, art+com build a prototypical nlp based service.\n Users can analyze large amounts of texts, e.g. their own text document or an wikipedia article, with a suitable interface. The backend service then outputs a result which includes entities like geographical places, historical events or persons. Users can select an entity and see on which pages it occurs and how often. A variety of filters make text more workable. Logical error in the output, for a example a term has been listed in the wrong category, can be fixed by dragging it to the correct category. I led the frontend development.",
